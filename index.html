      <h1 id="hobby">My favorite hobby is...<br>Soccer</h1>
      <p id="soccerparagraph">I have a hobby in a sport that includes a ball and no hands. Thats right, using hands is not allowed and only the goal keeper can possible touch the ball with his hands. There are many different types of roles to play in soccer. You can play goalkeeper, the person that stands near the goal and can use his hands so that way the other team cannot score on his goal. There is also the defenders. The defenders stay back and try their best to not let the other team score. Then there is the offense side of the team. This side tries to shoot the ball inside of the goal so that way they can get points. As you can guess, the team with the most points wins!
